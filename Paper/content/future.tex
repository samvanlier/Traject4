\section{Future Work}
This model is far from complete or prefect.
One major way it could be improved is in how and when relations change.
This projects uses a \textit{-1, +1} relationship strategy so that the overall number of edges stays relatively the same but it is not foul-proof in that regard.
A better method needs to be used that resembles real relationships or is more common in social networks dynamics.
This might improve the found results or sheds some light on aspects that are missed by this model.
