# Traject4 - Evolution of speech
This projects is a port of the code provide by Bart de Boer (see commit https://github.com/samvanlier/Traject4/commit/e594f8bac6f31ec1910a58101dd0562ee366d239).
The code comes from the paper [Multi-agent simulations of the evolution of combinatorial phonology](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1059712309345789) by de Boer and Zuidema.

After the port, the code is enhanced to test a new hypothese as part of the course "Evolution of Speech" ("Evolutie van Spraak" in Dutch) given at the Vrij Universiteit Brussel.
